# Customer Discovery Interview Script

**Purpose**: Understand how CrossFitters relate to music during workouts, what problems exist, and whether anyone would pay to solve them.

**Ground Rules (for you, the interviewer)**:
1. Do NOT mention your app, your idea, or that you're building anything
2. Do NOT ask "would you use X?" or "would you pay for Y?" — these produce lies
3. Ask about **past behavior**, not future intentions
4. When they say something interesting, ask "tell me more about that"
5. Shut up and listen. Aim for 80% them talking, 20% you.
6. Take notes immediately after, not during (it makes people self-conscious)

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Who to talk to**: Active CrossFitters (3+ sessions/week). Mix of:
- People who train at a box (gym)
- People who train at home / garage gym
- Coaches who program and run classes

---

## Opening (1-2 min)

> "Hey, I'm doing some research on the CrossFit training experience and I'd love to hear about yours. There are no right or wrong answers — I'm just trying to understand how people train. Cool?"

Do NOT say: "I'm building an app" / "I'm working on a startup" / "I have an idea"

---

## Section 1: Training Context (3-4 min)

Start broad. Understand their world before narrowing to music.

> "Walk me through a typical training day for you. What does it look like from when you arrive to when you leave?"

Follow-ups (only if they don't come up naturally):
- "How many days a week do you train?"
- "Do you mostly train at a gym or at home?"
- "Do you follow programmed workouts or make your own?"

**What you're listening for**: Does music come up naturally? If they don't mention music at all, that tells you a lot.

---

## Section 2: The Music Question (5-7 min)

Now gently steer toward music. Still don't mention your idea.

> "What role does music play in your training?"

Then dig deeper based on their answer:

**If they train at a box:**
- "Who picks the music at your gym?"
- "How do you feel about the music choices? Has there been a time when the music was really good or really bad for a workout?"
- "Tell me about that — what made it good/bad?"
- "Have you ever said anything to the coach about the music?"

**If they train at home / garage gym:**
- "What do you do for music when you work out?"
- "Walk me through what you did last time — did you pick a playlist, put on a station, something else?"
- "How much time do you spend on that?"
- "Has there been a time when the music really helped or really hurt a workout?"

**If they're a coach:**
- "How do you handle music for your classes?"
- "How much time do you spend on that per week?"
- "Have athletes ever given you feedback about the music?"
- "What's the most annoying part of dealing with music for class?"

**Key follow-up for everyone:**
> "Tell me about the last time you were really in the zone during a workout. What was going on? Was music part of that?"

**What you're listening for**:
- Do they care about music at all during workouts?
- Is music selection a *problem* or just a *thing that happens*?
- How much effort do they currently put into it?
- Do coaches spend real time on this? Is it a burden?

---

## Section 3: Current Solutions (3-4 min)

Understand what they already do. This reveals willingness to invest effort/money.

> "What apps or tools do you currently use for anything training-related?"

Follow-ups:
- "Do you pay for any of those?"
- "Have you ever tried any music apps specifically for working out?" (Fit Radio, RockMyRun, etc.)
- "What happened? Do you still use it?"
- If they use Spotify/Apple Music: "Do you ever make playlists specifically for workouts? What does that process look like?"

> "Have you ever tried to match the energy of music to different parts of a workout — like slower music for warm-up, faster for the WOD?"

**What you're listening for**:
- Are they already paying for fitness tools? (signals willingness to pay)
- Have they tried and abandoned workout music solutions? Why?
- Do they manually curate playlists? (= evidence of a real problem worth solving)
- Or do they just hit shuffle and not think about it? (= no real problem)

---

## Section 4: The Pain Stack (2-3 min)

Understand where music ranks among their actual problems.

> "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one annoying thing about your training experience, what would it be?"

Then:
> "What about a second thing? A third?"

**What you're listening for**:
- Does music come up at all in their top 3 frustrations?
- If it doesn't, that's a strong signal about problem severity
- What DO they complain about? (this is where pivot ideas come from)

---

## Section 5: Spending Patterns (2-3 min)

Don't ask "would you pay for X." Instead, understand what they already spend on.

> "Roughly, what do you spend on your training per month? Gym membership, gear, supplements, apps, whatever."

> "What was the last training-related thing you bought or subscribed to?"

> "Is there anything you've thought about buying but haven't pulled the trigger on?"

**What you're listening for**:
- Total spend on training (context for pricing)
- What categories they spend in (gear? apps? coaching? nutrition?)
- Price sensitivity signals
- Whether digital products / apps are in their spending habits at all

---

## Closing (1 min)

> "This has been really helpful. One last question — is there anyone else you think I should talk to? Maybe someone at your gym who's really into music, or a coach who puts a lot of effort into the class atmosphere?"

This gets you referrals for more interviews — the best ones come from warm intros.

Do NOT pitch your idea at the end. Do NOT say "actually, I'm building something for this." Save it. You'll bias your referrals.

## Tracking Your Interviews

After 10+ interviews, tally up:

| Signal | Count | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Music came up naturally | _/10 | |
| Music in top 3 frustrations | _/10 | |
| Currently pays for music apps | _/10 | |
| Manually curates workout playlists | _/10 | |
| Coach who spends real time on music | _/10 | |
| Mentioned a problem you hadn't considered | _/10 | |

**Decision thresholds:**
- **7+ people mention music unprompted** → Strong signal, double down
- **3-6 mention it when asked** → Moderate signal, need more data or a sharper angle
- **0-2 care about music** → Weak signal, seriously consider pivoting
- **Coaches consistently frustrated by music** → Pivot to B2B (sell to gyms)
- **A different problem keeps coming up** → Explore that as a pivot

## Common Traps to Avoid

| Trap | Why it's bad | What to do instead |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| "Would you use an app that..." | They'll say yes to be nice | Ask what they currently do |
| "How much would you pay for..." | Hypothetical = lies | Ask what they already pay for |
| "Don't you think it would be cool if..." | Leading question | Ask about past experiences |
| Talking about your background | Biases them to be supportive | Keep it about them |
| Only talking to friends | Friends lie the most | Talk to strangers |
| Interpreting "that's cool" as validation | Compliments are worthless data | Look for behavior, not opinions |
| Asking in a group setting | Social pressure = groupthink | 1-on-1 only |
